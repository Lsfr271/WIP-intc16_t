### created & started at 30/10/2025

## What is intc16_t?
- intc16_t is based of uint16_t. Its an unsigned integer but it has more features.


## Why create intc16_t?
- intc16_t was created to test my C++ skills. This is not expected to be used by anyone in coding
but if you want, you can use it.

## How to get started if you are interested
1- Download [intc16.hpp](https://github.com/Lsfr271/WIP-intc16_t/blob/main/src/intc16.hpp). Or copy the file contents into a file in your workspace.

2- Include it in a .cpp file. (your workspace structure can be different.)
```cpp
#include "../include/intc16.hpp"

int main() {
  /* your code */
}
```
