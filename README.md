## What is intc16_t?
- intc16_t is based of uint16_t. Its an unsigned integer but it has more features.


## Why create intc16_t?
- intc16_t was created to test my C++ skills. This is not expected to be used by anyone in coding
but if you want, you can use it.

## How to get started if you are interested?
1- Download [intc.hpp](https://github.com/Lsfr271/WIP-intc16_t/blob/main/src/intc.hpp). Or copy the file contents into a file in your workspace.

2- Include it in a .cpp file. I cannot show you how because your workspace structure can be different.
But heres how I include it.

```cpp
#include "../include/intc.hpp"

int main() {
  /* your code */
}
```
