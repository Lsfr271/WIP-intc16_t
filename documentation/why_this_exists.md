## Why intc16_t exists

- intc16_t exists because its a project to test my skills in c++, by manipulating built in data-types like uint16_t.
And i dont expect anyone to use it, but if you want you can.

## Why 16-bit verison?

- I chose the 16 bit version because 32 & 64 bits are way too large and i think 65535 is a reasonable amount. If you consider
8 bit version it has a bit of downsides. The maximum number of 255 is really small and its rarely used unless you want specific bit
manipulation. So thats my entire reasoning as why I picked 16-bit.
