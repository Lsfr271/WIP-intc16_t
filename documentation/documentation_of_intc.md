## CURRENT DOCUMENTATION -30/10/2025

The file header includes `iostream` and `cstdint` for now. `iostream` for printing and operator modifiying to make intc16_t printable to the console.
Currently the main code is in one file in [intc.hpp](https://github.com/Lsfr271/WIP-intc16_t/blob/main/src/intc.hpp).

Current plans for the future is to expand this into multiple files soon.
